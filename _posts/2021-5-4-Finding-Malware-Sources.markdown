Malware analysis labs are only useful if you have code samples to study. Part of my lab setup I am working on improving is expanding where I find malware samples to find more intresting techniques and get more diverse samples.

## 1. Malware-Traffic-Analysis

## 2. MalwareBazaar

## 3. CTFs

## 4. Pastebin

## 5. Email Addresses

## 6. Honeypots

Honeypots are intentionally vulnerable systems designed to be attacked. They can be connected to the Internet to see how attackers interact with them to gain insights about their actions. This includes collection any malware samples attackers try to download and execute on the system. 

The honeypot project I am currently running is [Cowrie](https://github.com/cowrie/cowrie). It is an open-source medium interaction honeypot written in Python. I have it exposed on ports 22 and 23 to have SSH and Telnet facing the Internet. Attackers scanning the Internet can find my system, log in to the honeypot with SSH or Telnet using weak credientals configured in Cowrie, and then start to attempt to attack the server. Any files downloaded with wget are saved along with information about IP addresses, credientals used to login, and any commands entered in the fake terminal to a location outside of the honeypot. 

An intresting part of collecting malware from a honeypot rather than other sources is that many of the samples still have live command and control servers running and distributing them assuming you start analysis soon enough after. Several times I have been able to capture one malware sample, go to the IP address where the sample was downloaded from, and found the attacker's command and control server containing the sample compiled for multiple architectures, more stages of the malware, and other files they used to run the malware. 

One goal I have with this honeypot is capturing IOT malware. SSH and Telnet with weak credientals is a very common inital entry point for IOT attacks as shown with the Mirai Botnet. The credientals and additional customization for files on the system, running processes, and CPU architecture, can make the honeypot look like a real IOT device.

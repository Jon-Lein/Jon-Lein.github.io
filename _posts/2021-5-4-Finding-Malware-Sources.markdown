Malware analysis labs are only useful if you have code samples to study. Part of my lab setup I am working on improving is expanding where I find malware samples to find more intresting techniques and get more diverse samples.

## 1. Malware-Traffic-Analysis

## 2. MalwareBazaar

## 3. CTFs

## 4. Pastebin

## 5. Email Addresses

## 6. Honeypots

Honeypots are intentionally vulnerable systems designed to be attacked. They can be connected to the Internet to see how attackers interact with them to gain insights about their actions. This includes collection any malware samples attackers try to download and execute on the system.
